DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM: This program implements a linked list (of signed integers of 
type Int), using pointers and object-oriented programming, similar to the C++ Standard 
Template Library, from scratch. A Node and Linked_List class are implemented as well as 
the methods such as: get_length(), print(), clear(), push_front(), push_back, insert(), 
sort_ascending(), sort_descending(). The sort_ascending() method sorts using the 
recursive Merge sort algorithm and changes the pointers on the node rather than swapping 
the values between nodes. A method is also included to count the number of prime numbers 
in the linked list. An application is also used to receive input from the user and to 
execute the implemented linked list and all functionality is done on the linked list, not
another data structure. The number 1 will intentionlly not be counted as a prime number. 
Lastly, this assignment was submitted passed the deadline so use my remaining late days.
